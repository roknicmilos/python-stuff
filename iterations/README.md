# Iterators and Iterables

Python’s **iterators** and **iterables** are two different
but related tools that come in handy when you need to iterate
over a data stream or container.

- **Iterators** power and control the iteration process
- **iterables** typically hold data that you want to iterate
  over one value at a time.

Iterations can be categorized as **definite** and **indefinite**.

- **Indefinite** iterations, like those using a `while` loop, run
  for an unspecified number of times until a certain condition is
  met.
- **Definite** iterations, using a `for` loop, run a specified
  number of times based on the sequence they're iterating over.

## Iterators

A Python **object** is considered an iterator when it implements
**two special methods** collectively known as the **iterator
protocol**:

- `__iter__`: Called to initialize the iterator. It must return
  an iterator object.
- `__next__`: Called to iterate over the iterator. It must return
  the next value in the data stream. Used internally by `next()`
  function that allows you to traverse an iterator without a formal
  loop. This possibility can be helpful when you’re working with
  infinite iterators or with iterators that have an unknown number
  of items.

Python uses iterators under the hood to support every operation
that requires iteration, including `for` loops, comprehensions,
iterable unpacking, and more.

### Iterator Types

- Iterators that **yield original data** (example:
  [SequenceIterator](./iterators/sequence_iterator.py))
- Iterators that **yield transform data** (example:
  [SquareIterator](./iterators/square_iterator.py))
- Iterators that **yield generate data** (example:
  [FibonacciIterator](./iterators/fibonacci_iterator.py))

### Generators

Generator functions are special types of functions that allow you
to create iterators using a **functional style**.
The function-based iterator is way simpler and more straightforward
to write and understand compared to its class-based equivalent.

Check out [these generator examples](./iterators/generators.py).

### Memory Efficiency

Iterators and generators are **pretty memory-efficient** when you
compare them with regular functions, container data types, and
comprehensions.
With iterators and generators, you don’t need to store all the data
in memory (RAM) at the same time. Iterators **keep only one data
item in memory at a time**, generating the next items on demand or
**lazily**.

Another important memory-related difference between iterators,
functions, data structures, and comprehensions is that iterators
are the **only way to process infinite data streams**.

### Async Iterators

They are the same as regular iterators, except instead of using
iterator protocol methods, they use something we can call **async
iterator protocol**. This protocol is based on two methods:

- `__aiter__`: It must return an async iterator object.
- `__anext__`: It must return an awaitable object from a stream.
  It must raise a `StopAsyncIteration` exception when the iterator
  is exhausted.

### Constraints of Iterators

- You can’t iterate over an iterator more than once
    - but you could implement workarounds
- Tightly connected to the previous one, you can’t reset an
  exhausted iterator to start iteration again
- You can only move forward through an iterator, you can’t move
  backward
    - there is no `__previous__` method, only `__next__`
- You can’t know their length or number of items
    - you can only know it only after you consume iterator data
- Iterators don’t allow indexing and slicing operations with the
  [] operator

## Iterables

When it comes to iteration in Python, you’ll often hear people
talking about iterable objects or just iterables.
As the name suggests, an iterable is an **object that you can
iterate over**.
To perform this iteration, you’ll typically use a `for` loop.

Simple way of checking if object is iterable: pass it to `iter()`
function, and if it doesn't raise `TypeError`the object is
iterable.

A Python object is considered an iterable when it implements one
special method known as the **iterable protocol**. This method
is `__iter__`.

Pure iterable objects typically hold the data themselves.
Common iterable objects in Python are `lists`, `tuples`,
`dictionaries`, `sets`, `string`, `ranges`, `files`, etc.

Iterables don't have to implement **iterable protocol**. Instead,
they can implement **sequence protocol** using these two methods:

- `__len__`
- `__getitem__`

When passing an object that implements those two magic methods to
`iter()` function, Python will build an iterator using those two
methods even without implementation of `__iter__` method.

`reversed()` function calls `__reverse__` method of iterable
object (e.g. with list, tuples and dictionaries), but if it is
not implemented, it uses `__len__` and `__getitem___` methods
(e.g. with strings).

Check out this simple [Iterable](./iterables/iterable.py) example.
