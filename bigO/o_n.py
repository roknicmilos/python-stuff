items = list(range(1, 10))

"""
If we increase the range to 10x more than the previous range, 
the time it takes to create the list will also increase by 10x.
This is because the time complexity of creating a list is directly
proportional to the size of the range.

This is called O(n) or LINEAR TIME COMPLEXITY.
