"""
Encapsulation is a concept that restricts access to certain
details of an object and only exposes what is necessary,
like a protective shield.

The main goal of encapsulation is to protect the internal
state of an object and ensure that the objectâ€™s methods are
used to manipulate that state in a controlled manner.

Encapsulation is achieved with access modifiers (private,
protected, public), getter and setter.
