# Object Oriented Programming

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm
centered around objects rather than functions and procedures.

## 2 key components of or OOP

- **Objects** are like real-world entities. Each object has
  attributes (data) and behaviors (methods).

- **Classes** are blueprints for creating objects. A class
  defines a type of object according to its properties and
  behaviors.

## 4 main principles of OOP

- **Inheritance** allows a class (child) to inherit properties
  and methods from another class (parent), promoting code reuse.

- **Encapsulation** is a concept that restricts access to certain
  details of an object and only exposes what is necessary, like
  a protective shield. The main goal of encapsulation is to
  protect the internal state of an object and ensure that the
  objectâ€™s methods are used to manipulate that state in a
  controlled manner. Encapsulation is achieved with access
  modifiers (private, protected, public), getter and setter.

- **Polymorphism** describes the concept that you can access
  objects of different types through the same interface. Each
  type can provide its own independent implementation of this
  interface.

- **Abstraction** is a concept we use for reducing complexity by
  hiding the unnecessary details and highlighting the essential
  characteristics. It focuses on exposing only the relevant aspects
  of an object, making it easier to use and understand. It
  involves using interfaces or abstract classes to define and
  enforce method signatures without specifying their implementation.
