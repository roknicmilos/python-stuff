"""
Abstraction is a concept we use for reducing complexity by
hiding the unnecessary details and highlighting the essential
characteristics.

It focuses on exposing only the relevant aspects of an object,
making it easier to use and understand.

Abstraction involves using interfaces or abstract classes to
define and enforce method signatures without specifying their
implementation.
